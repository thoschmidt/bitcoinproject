        	<h2>Satoshi Nakamoto and the Creation of Bitcoin</h2>
          <p class="largerParagraph">&emsp;&emsp;On November 1, 2008, a man by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto released a research paper, describing the construction of a digital currency he called “Bitcoin” (Nakamoto).

Unfortunately, in the world of digital currency, the money was just that—digital.  This created a problem: if the money was simply information, what prevents people from copying this information and re-spending the same dollar continuously?  Many of the previous versions of digital currency responded by keeping a real-time ledger of all transactions that occur.  However, while this prevented fraud, it also required a trusted third party to administer the ledger.

        	<p class="largerParagraph">&emsp;&emsp;Nakamoto responded by publicly distributing the ledger.  Transactions were broadcasted to the network through a uniquely designed process.  Computers running the software would compete to solve cryptographic puzzles that contained data from several transactions.  The first person to crack the puzzle would be awarded a specific number of bitcoins and the associated block of transactions were added to the chain (Nakamoto). Users would be able to gain bitcoins, through bitcoin mining, by solving the cryptographic puzzles that protect the block of transaction information.  The size of each block bounty would halve every 210,000 blocks, starting at 50 and then decreasing to 25, etc.The currency would reach a preordained limit of 21 million bitcoins around 2140 (Gustke).</p>

  <p class="c0"><span>-Jon Matonis, Bitcoin Foundation, Vienna Austria November
  2012</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>In his November 2012 address to the DeepSec Security Conference at
  the Imperial Riding School in Vienna, Austria, Jon Matonis, e-Money researcher and
  secretary of the Bitcoin Foundation claimed that the fiat currencies of the world were
  about to face a peer-to-peer network disruptor equivalent to the upheaval that the
  music and movie industries faced about a decade earlier. &nbsp;The question circulating
  through many people&rsquo;s minds has been:</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c9">&ldquo;Is Bitcoin the digital cash that will make this a
  reality?&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>BitTorrent turned the music and movie industries on their heads and
  profoundly affected digital content distribution through the ability of users to
  rapidly exchange files over a peer-to-peer internet network. If Bitcoin fits this
  analogy, then it has the chance to disrupt currency and the world as we know it with
  incredible destructive and constructive power.</span> <span class="c3 c9">Examining the
  fundamental ethical and policy implications of bitcoin are crucial towards navigating
  it to its potential success and directing its power for the good of society.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">The Chaotic and Exciting World of Bitcoin</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Answering these important ethical and policy questions is
  challenging. The bitcoin world is rapidly growing and changing. The first bitcoins were
  only mined in 2009 (&ldquo;Genesis Block&rdquo;). Less than four years later, the
  bitcoin distributed computing network is one of the largest distributed computing
  networks in the world that eclipses funded projects such as SETI decades its superior
  (Matonis). There are currently over $140 million of bitcoins in circulation today
  (&ldquo;Market Circulation&rdquo;).</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>The rapid rise of bitcoin that makes the bitcoin world precisely so
  exciting and interesting, also makes it vast, complex, and chaotic. Reuters has called
  it &ldquo;the Wild West of finance&rdquo; as an army of sites of varying credibility
  have popped up to</span> <span>emulate financial industry</span> <span>services with
  Bitcoin equivalents (O&rsquo;Leary). &nbsp;In the bitcoin world, venture backed
  startups like CoinLab (CoinLab) run alongside 17-year-old-run exchanges like Bitcoinica
  (O&rsquo;Leary); Bitcoin monetary activists fight central bank tyranny in the same
  online forums as questionable characters executing ponzi schemes (&ldquo;Bitcoin ponzi
  scheme - investors lose $5 million USD in online hedge fund.&rdquo;); the largest
  exchange is a converted Magic The Gathering Trading Card hub (</span><span class=
  "c9">Mt. Gox Company Overview</span><span>); and the latest news and cutting edge
  opinion rests not only in academic cryptography papers, but on community sites, in
  online forum posts, and within the blogs of authors with unverified
  credentials.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span>In order to discuss the i</span><span>mportant
  c</span><span>omputer ethics and policy questions that bitcoin raises, we&rsquo;ll
  attempt to give an overview of bitcoin and what makes it unique as a digital currency
  before providing an opportunity to discuss the fascinating implications of these
  qualities.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3 c5">Concepts</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">What Makes Bitcoin Unique as a Digital
  Currency?</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Jon Matonis, secretary of the Bitcoin Foundation that serves as a
  custodian of the open source software that Bitcoin rests upon explains
  bitcoin:</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c4 c2"><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c9">Bitcoin is a decentralised
  electronic cash system using peer-to-peer networking, digital signatures and
  cryptographic proof to enable irreversible payments between parties without relying on
  trust.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Breaking down his statement gives us an ideal of what makes bitcoin
  unique as a digital currency. While this site goes further in depth into the validity
  of each characteristic and bitcoin&rsquo;s technology, at a high level these qualities
  are the root of bitcoin&rsquo;s ethical and policy implications:</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c4 c2"><span>Decentralized Control</span></p>

  <p class="c4 c2"><span>No Central Authority</span></p>

  <p class="c4 c2"><span>Dependency on Technology and Cryptography</span></p>

  <p class="c4 c2"><span>Predictable and Limited Supply</span></p>

  <p class="c4 c2"><span>Freeze-Proof Accounts</span></p>

  <p class="c2 c4"><span>Low Transfer Rates</span></p>

  <p class="c4 c2"><span>Anonymity</span></p>

  <p class="c4 c2"><span>Untrackable and Untaxable</span></p>

  <p class="c4 c2"><span>Variable Barriers to Entry</span></p>

  <p class="c1 c4"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Decentralized Control</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Bitcoins are created and sustained using a peer-to-peer network of
  computers that compute cryptographic hashes that provide bitcoin authenticity. The
  network consists of every bitcoin user who has a full wallet program running on their
  computer in addition to super-users &ldquo;miners&rdquo; who dedicate special hardware
  to contribute extra computing power to the network that is rewarded with a trickle of
  bitcoins. The network as a whole supports the creation of new bitcoins and all bitcoin
  transactions. In theory, no single entity controls bitcoin. This has a number of
  implications:</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">No Central Authority</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Every fiat currency in the world is issued by a central sovereign
  entity and depends on that entity to maintain its value. As a result, the currency is
  under the control of that central authority. Online currencies such as Voucher-Safe,
  Zynga dollars, or Facebook Credits all also depend on a central authority
  (&ldquo;Virtual Currency Schemes&rdquo;). Furthermore, transactions occurring online
  with those currencies must all go directly through a single source that acts as a
  trusted intermediary.</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the largest
  draws for bitcoin users is that the existence of bitcoin does not depend on a central
  authority (</span><span>Yang</span><span>). Since the thousands of computers on the
  bitcoin network collectively sustain the currency, no one authority has the power to
  control the currency. A central authority cannot manipulate the currency, nor is the
  currency vulnerable to an attack on a single entity.</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The theoretical
  lack of a central authority raises huge ethical implications for bitcoin. Furthermore,
  the advent of massive &ldquo;mining pools&rdquo; that wield entire quarters of the
  computing power on the bitcoin network and the custodial role of the Bitcoin Foundation
  for the bitcoin source code leads some to debate the true level of bitcoin&rsquo;s
  decentralization.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Dependency on Technology and Cryptography</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of relying
  on a central authority for it legitimacy, Bitcoin rests on technology and cryptography.
  In discussing this technology, other sections explain how this is potentially one of
  Bitcoin&rsquo;s greatest strengths and biggest weaknesses. Technology and cryptography
  attempts to circumvent the unpredictability and insecurity of human behavior, but it
  comes at the cost of vulnerability when either of the two pillars fail.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Predictable and Limited Supply</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Because the supply of Bitcoins is determined by an consistent
  algorithm and not a central authority, the supply of bitcoin is regular and predictable
  (Barber et al.). Fiat currencies usually experience inflation (a decrease in value
  unit) due to the decisions of a central issuing authority to issue more monetary units.
  In contrast, the steady number of bitcoins in circulation will eventually reach an
  algorithmically determined ceiling and experience deflation (an increase in value per a
  unit). However, bitcoins make up for their numerical predictability with the wild
  fluctuations in their exchange value with mainstream fiat currencies like the US dollar
  as the currency grows with more adopters. The fixed number of total bitcoin units has
  important policy implications for the long term value of the currency and for entities
  that hold it.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Freeze-Proof Accounts</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class=
  "c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Individual bitcoin
  wallets are simply encrypted files stored on a computer or in &ldquo;cold
  storage&rdquo; - storage which is offline, such as a USB drive or printed paper - that
  allows a user to transfer bitcoins (Matonis). The actual record of bitcoins themselves
  are stored in every node of the bitcoin network. Other online currencies depend on a
  central authority to keep records. This allows a user&rsquo;s account to be
  &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; and confiscated by a third party, such as a government agency,
  that wields power over the central trusted intermediary that holds the account
  information. With bitcoin&rsquo;s distributed nature a bitcoin wallet cannot be
  controlled by anyone but the person with its associated encryption key (&ldquo;How
  Bitcoin Works&rdquo;).</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Low Transfer Rates</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transferring
  bitcoin is either free or requires a minimal fee determined by the open source bitcoin
  software for the machines contributing to the processing power of the network based on
  the load of the network at the time of the transfer. Rates are independent of an
  arbitrary central authority and are not burdened by the costs of banks or the
  transportation of moving physical assets.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Anonymity</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>When a bitcoin transaction is made, the wallet addresses and
  amounts involved are broadcast to the entire network of bitcoin nodes. Public transfers
  are how the distributed bitcoin network verifies transactions and prevents malicious
  users from double spending bitcoins. However, while the addresses are public, a user
  can generate a virtually unlimited number of addresses. This means that unless a user
  publicly exposes their wallet address, their wallets are theoretically detached from
  their identities.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>The decoupling of bitcoin wallets from owner&rsquo;s identities
  adds an extra layer of privacy to the system. Users of traditional financial systems
  usually depend on a third party, like a Swiss bank, to keep their accounts and
  identities private. However, this leaves depositors at risk to exposure if the third
  party is compromised or coerced. Bitcoin wallets on the other hand allow the account
  owner more responsibility over their privacy.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Untrackable and Untaxable</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Unlike existing payment systems that depend on central trusted
  intermediaries, such as PayPal, bitcoin transactions are theoretically
  &ldquo;untraceable&rdquo; (&ldquo;How Bitcoin Works&rdquo;). Every coin transaction is
  seen and verified by the network as a whole, but because the ownership of addresses is
  secret, there is no reasonable way to know where and to whom bitcoins are being
  transferred (Ron). Some academics have been able to use advanced math to trace some
  bitcoin origins of incautious owners, but the degree of difficulty might be equated to
  tracking marked physical US dollars.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp; There is no way to directly intercept bitcoin transactions.
  This means that it is impossible for a government to directly tax bitcoin transactions
  since the transactions cannot be traced from person to person. Other sections discuss
  how the government can still tax and regular Bitcoin related activities, but pure
  digital Bitcoins themselves are by nature untaxable and unregulatable
  (Jackson).</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>These two traits of Bitcoin make it both an idea means for the
  informal economy of the world which depends on cash like transactions of over 10
  trillion US dollars a year (&ldquo;There is Big Money in the Underground
  Economy&rdquo;). It also makes the currency a viable vehicle for illicit purposes such
  as money laundering and tax evasion.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Variable Barriers to Entry</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Technically Bitcoin has a very low barrier to entry. A potential
  participant in the Bitcoin network only needs a computer and an internet connect to
  download a free copy of Bitcoin open source software to receive or send Bitcoins.
  However, the nascent adoption of Bitcoin means that despite its rapid growth, Bitcoin
  requires full participants in its economy to have a level of technological savvy and
  Bitcoin knowhow above the average computer user. Understanding how to use the software
  properly to protect one&rsquo;s privacy is nontrivial.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Furthermore, there is no regulation of site dedicated to Bitcoin.
  An unwary entrant can easily fall prey to malicious members among the many benevolent
  ones of the Bitcoin community if they are not knowledgeable and careful. Due to its
  early stages and lack of central issuing authority, Bitcoin&rsquo;s exchange rate with
  traditional fiat-currencies still fluctuates dramatically. Thus, simply buying Bitcoins
  can be risky for the unqualified user.</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3 c5">Context and Motivations</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">The Ethical Motivations for Bitcoin</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Bitcoin and the Ethic of a Cashless Society</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Among the many global trends that have motivated bitcoin. One of
  the most prominent and poignant is the rise of the &ldquo;cashless society&rdquo; and
  the ethical and policy implications it has for people making transactions around the
  world. Understanding the &ldquo;cashless society&rdquo; is fundamental to understanding
  the ethical context that serves as one of the key motivators for bitcoin&rsquo;s
  existence.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">What is a Cashless Society?</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>In the world of online transactions that bitcoin inhabits, a hot
  topic of discussion is the &ldquo;cashless society&rdquo; (Stevenson). When
  commentators talk of a &ldquo;cashless society&rdquo; they refer to the increasing
  trend of fiat currency transactions moving into the digital world and away from
  physical cash and coins. The movement can be traced to the advent of credit cards in
  the 1950s, but increasingly transactions are moving to the Internet
  (Stephey).</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>In many ways, many of us in the developed world are already living
  in a near cashless society. Online shoppers make virtually all of their transactions on
  sites like Amazon, Ebay, and PayPal through online banking or credit lines without even
  touching physical cards. In the physical world, companies like Square that helps
  merchant more easily accept credit cards on mobile devices, make it easier and easier
  to go without ever having to touch paper or metal.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Benefits of a Cashless Society</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>The benefits of a cashless society are convenience, efficiency, and
  record keeping. Jon Matonis of the Bitcoin Foundation notes that a completely cashless
  society seems to have a number of benefits:</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>-No inconvenient bulky paper cash or coins</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-No anonymous
  transactions</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>-No untraceable transactions</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>-No parallel or &lsquo;grey&rsquo; economy</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>-No costs to produce cash and move it</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>-No missing taxes</span></p>

  <p class="c2">
  <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matonis)</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Convenience</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first glance,
  eliminating cash in favor of online transactions seems wholly positive. Cash is more
  convenient for the consumer. Physical currency like the US dollar is clunky and
  expensive to produce. &nbsp;Rather than carrying around physical units of value, it is
  far easier to have an account in cyberspace that allows you to track and exchange your
  assets.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Security</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Because participants are attached to their identities in a cashless
  society, transactions can be made with a level of trust between two parties who are
  both vetted by the the online entity or service they are transacting through. Because
  all transactions are tracked, users can have greater assurance that any attempts to
  steal their assets will leave a clear trail of transactions online to follow.
  &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Legitimacy</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Trusted central intermediaries that facilitate the cashless ideal,
  such as PayPal, can also serve as monitors against illicit transactions. If all
  monetary transactions are tracked and attached to identities of participants, all
  transactions have to be legitimate. Without cash it is impossible for the parallel
  &ldquo;grey&rdquo; or &ldquo;under the table&rdquo; and &ldquo;black&rdquo; economies
  to operate. In a cashless society, businesses and workers that illegally circumvent
  taxes by taking &ldquo;cash payments&rdquo; can be much more easily caught when their
  transaction histories are all tracked. More importantly, more nefarious organizations,
  such as drug cartels, thrive on the anonymity and untraceability of cash
  transactions.</span> <span>In a completely, cashless society preventing large illegal
  transactions and money laundering when it can be monitored online is much easier than
  when it can happen offline through a physical exchange. &nbsp;Tracking transactions
  gives central authorities more tools to eliminate such activity.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Dangers of a Cashless Society</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there are
  many benefits to the cashless society the world is moving towards, a cashless society
  is a double edged sword. In fact, many of the qualities that make a cashless society so
  convenient, also make it so dangerous for abuse. The ethics of whether a cashless
  society is a better society become much more murky. Jon Matonis of the Bitcoin
  Foundation notes the following dangers when a society removes cash:</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-All personal
  transactions can be traced</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Users become
  completely dependent on electronics and networks</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Central
  authorities have complete control over all currency</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Tax collection is
  inescapable</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The shadow economy
  is completely eliminated</span></p>

  <p class="c2">
  <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matonis)</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Privacy</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>One of the largest concerns of a cashless society is the privacy of
  transactions. The migration of fiat currency transactions online does not just mean
  that drug cartel money is under scrutiny. It also means that the financial privacy of
  innocent individuals is at risk to exposure by the central authorities through which
  transactions operate. It is no secret that the government closely monitors banking
  transactions with the help of companies such as Palantir that analyze data. If all
  transactions move online, there is nothing that central authorities will not
  know.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Financial history can be extremely personal information. Does a
  teenager really want someone to know they recently bought birth control pills? How
  public would a patient want to make their purchase of an HIV drug? Removing cash,
  removes an avenue through which a spender can keep such purchases private.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Abuse of Central Authority</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial privacy
  from authority is also a primary concern because of the potential for authoritative
  abuse. In an idyllic world, a citizen of a cashless society who does no wrong should
  not have to worry about running into trouble if an authority like PayPal or the
  government</span> <span>benevolently monitors their financial history.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>However, what if a central authority is not so benevolent. Movement
  towards completely tracked and identified transactions allows for closer monitoring of
  citizens that can be abused by central authorities. Authoritarian governments can use
  such knowledge to suppress funding for social movements or track down opposition
  movements. Central sources that control transactions that can easily be shut down,
  coerced, or manipulated by central authorities to arbitrarily deny users access to
  their funds.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Furthermore, as currently benevolent governments gain more
  authority into the lives of individuals, when do they cross the line and resemble
  authoritarian regimes themselves? Resentment against unjust tax collection was one of
  the compelling reasons for the American Revolution. In this context, the inescapability
  of tax collection under a cashless society strikes as poignantly foreboding.</span></p>

  <p class="c1 c7"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Elimination of Informal Commerce</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the most
  overlooked danger of the move towards a cashless society is the loss of the informal
  economy - also known as the &ldquo;grey&rdquo; or &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; economy. While
  eliminating cash dependent and dangerous black market activity, such as drug and
  weapons dealing, has few detractors, the informal economy that operates in cash is of a
  very different nature.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>The informally economy is all &ldquo;under the table&rdquo; cash
  activity that is not tracked by official channels. This includes street sellers&rsquo;
  commerce, unreported waitress&rsquo;s tips, and informal exchange of money for small
  duties. In the developing world, the growth of the informal economy is usually one of
  the key driving economic factors in development (&ldquo;There is Big Money in the
  Underground Economy.&rdquo;). Around the world, it is estimated that the informal
  economy is 10 trillion USD of transactions annually.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Many of the poorest parts of society depend on these informal
  transactions that go untaxed and untracked to survive. If society moved to become
  completely cashless, this informal sector that depends on cash would be eliminated,
  potentially stifling economic growth and widening the gap between people with the means
  to engage in online, taxed transactions in the informal economy, and those who cannot
  afford to do so. The reality of a cashless society calls into question the ethics of
  whether or not shaking out the shadow economy is worth the societal cost to its
  participants even if their engagement is technically illegal.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">A Personal Ethical Dilemma</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental
  danger of relinquishing physical cash to the cashless society is that the participants
  in the new economy no longer have a valuable avenue in cash to exercise their privacy,
  anonymity, and control over the value they own. Participants are morally faced with the
  ethical dilemma of whether or not the dangers of a cashless society are worth the
  benefits. However, in reality the individual has little ability to affect the momentum
  of the cashless movement, and therefore they are forced to confront the dangers of its
  adoption.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Solution: Bitcoin = Digital Cash</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Bitcoin was created as an answer to this ethical dilemma of the
  cashless society. Bitcoin is a digital cash. According to Bitcoin Foundation Secretary,
  Jon Matonis, digital cash is an attempt to emulate the characteristics of</span>
  <span>physical currency in the digital world. It particularly aims to</span>
  <span>safeguard financial privacy, untraceability, and anonymity</span>
  <span>(&ldquo;There is Big Money in the Underground Economy.&rdquo;). The details of
  bitcoin&rsquo;s implem</span><span class="c12">entation and the ethical and policy
  issues that surround its place in society are discussed in other areas of this site.
  However, understanding that they also exist in the context of our near cashless society
  gives their relation to bitcoin a deeper meaning. &nbsp;In an effort to serve as the
  &ldquo;digital cash&rdquo; of the &ldquo;physical cashless society&rdquo; bitcoin at
  its core is an instrument of ethics.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Technology Behind the Security and Privacy of
  Bitcoin</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Making Trust Obsolete</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>In the priming paper on Bitcoin in which Satoshi Nakamoto explains
  the design and purpose of Bitcoin, he states that the current financial system at large
  &ldquo;suffers from the &nbsp;inherent &nbsp;weaknesses &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;trust
  &nbsp;based &nbsp;model.&rdquo; Specifically, the &ldquo;trust based model&rdquo;
  creates a number of inefficiencies in financial transactions, such as an inability to
  make non-reversible payments&mdash;so long as payments can be traced back to the those
  who interacted to make them, trust is necessary in order to prevent fraudulent
  transactions and merchants must demand more information of their customers than really
  necessary (Nakamoto).</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>What Nakamoto desired was an online replacement for physical
  currency, which is not traceable and requires no trust between those involved in the
  payment, as the currency is worth exactly what it says without strings attached. At the
  time of writing, Nakamoto noted that &ldquo;no mechanism exists to make payments over a
  communications channel without a trusted party.&rdquo; He went on to state that
  &ldquo;&hellip;what is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic
  proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each
  other without the need for a trusted third party&rdquo; (Nakamoto).</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Cryptographic Hashing and Network
  Verification</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>To understand the ethical and policy implications of Bitcoin, it is
  important to understand how the technology behind Bitcoin allows for secure
  transactions of currency while maintaining anonymity and integrity of the transaction.
  Specifically, a Bitcoin transaction relies on a cryptographic hash that verifies a
  transaction using the original Bitcoin holder&rsquo;s private key to generate a
  signature. That signature can be verified with the holder&rsquo;s public key
  (Nakamoto).</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Whenever a Bitcoin transaction is made, it is signed with the
  sender&rsquo;s private key and then publicly announced to the rest of the network so
  that it can be verified by the rest of the system using the block&rsquo;s public key.
  &nbsp;An individual Bitcoin stores a chain of these transaction signatures, which is
  essentially a history of all the transactions a single Bitcoin has been through. This
  ensures uniqueness of Bitcoins, as each one has a unique history that cannot be
  duplicated easily (Nakamoto).</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Additionally, to check if an individual was involved in a
  transaction, one can simply compare the electronic signature generated by their private
  key to the signature on the Bitcoin. This ensures validity of the transaction while
  maintaining anonymity, as the signature itself is the result of a one-way hash: the
  actor in the transaction cannot be easily determined from the signature, only verified
  (Reid).</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Bitcoin further increases anonymity by separating Bitcoin wallet
  addresses that store Bitcoins from the identities of the wallet owners. Any user can
  generate an almost unlimited number of Bitcoin addresses. In fact, many Bitcoin wallet
  client programs encourage users to generate a new address for every transaction that
  they make ("How Bitcoin works&rdquo;). A traditional bank client has a set amount of
  accounts linked to their name and must depend on the bank to keep their ownership
  private. A Bitcoin user can change their bank account every time they receive or
  transfer Bitcoins.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3 c5">Technologic Dilemmas</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">The Security of Cryptographic Hashing and Network
  Verification</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>The Bitcoin protocol currently ensures the security and anonymity
  of transactions in the Bitcoin system using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm . This
  algorithm is accepted to be secure because current computing theory has not found a way
  to reasonably reverse the hashing algorithm (Yang, &ldquo;The Cryptography of
  Bitcoin&rdquo;). It is the same kind of state of the art cryptography used by modern
  banking institutions (Yang, &ldquo;Bitcoin is Not Decentralized&rdquo;).</span></p>

  <p class="c1 c7"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">The Human Element</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>The algorithm can be trusted to give anonymity to those involved in
  a transaction, but it depends on the user keeping their wallet addresses secure (Reid).
  Once an identity is compromised, that identity can be linked to any Bitcoin transaction
  that it underwent. This means that the privacy and security of a Bitcoin transaction
  depends as much on the user following safe protocols as it does on the technology to
  carry out those protocols.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">No Cryptographic Hash Lasts Forever</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Another weakness in Bitcoin privacy and security is that no
  cryptographic hash function can 100% guarantee security. The short course of computer
  science history has seen many cryptographic functions broken long before their creators
  believed they would be invalidated. For example, MD5 is a popular hash function that
  was &ldquo;broken&rdquo; and rendered cryptographically insecure only a few years after
  its release (Aurora).</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">There is No Such Thing as Perfect</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>The ethical issue that arises as a result of Bitcoin&rsquo;s
  technology is that the Bitcoin network does its best to give anonymity and integrity of
  transactions to its users, but it cannot guarantee them entirely. It would be
  unreasonable for any system to guarantee 100% safety for its participants. Nonetheless,
  it is important for users to take these unknowns into their decision making process
  when it involves something as important as their finances.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Decentralized&rdquo; Centrality: Timestamp
  Servers</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Double counting of transactions
  is a small but significant problem for Bitcoin. In a traditional banking system this is
  handled by a central authority that ensures no transaction is made twice. This check is
  a challenging thing to achieve in a decentralized system such as Bitcoin. In fact, it
  is actually not solvable without some sort of ad hoc centralized system.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Bitcoin&rsquo;s solution is a system of timestamp servers that
  verify transactions according to the time of their execution, so that no Bitcoin can be
  double counted. These servers additionally verify Bitcoin transactions by checking
  digital signatures. In order to perform valid checking, these servers give a
  &ldquo;proof-of-work&rdquo; statement that is verified by other servers in the network
  in turn (Nakamoto).</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>These transaction servers are not directly centralized, but are
  instead crowdsourced by delegating the work to the computers of Bitcoin users that act
  as transaction servers. In exchange for supporting the integrity of the network, users
  are randomly rewarded an amount of Bitcoins in the course of performing verification.
  This is what the Bitcoin community refers to as &ldquo;mining.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c1 c7"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">The Bitcoin Foundation: A Central Authority for a
  Decentralized System?</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>The authority which sets the rate at which Bitcoins can be
  mined</span><span>, is called the</span> <span>Bitcoin Foundation. The
  foundation&rsquo;s website says that the &ldquo;Foundation standardizes, protect and
  promotes the use of Bitcoin cryptographic money for the benefit of users
  worldwide&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Bitcoin Foundation&rdquo;). In addition to setting the
  rate of bitcoin mining, the organization also maintains Bitcoin&rsquo;s open source
  code. The organization presents an interesting dilemma as a central authority for a
  &ldquo;decentralized&rdquo; system. Only time will tell what role it will play in
  Bitcoin&rsquo;s future and if the currency can still be kept successfully decentralized
  when a single organization has the potential to exert a significant amount of
  control.</span></p>

  <p class="c1 c7"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Dilemma of Abolishing Trust</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of Bitcoin
  does not simply make trust obsolete, but in fact discourages trust by concealing
  identity through signatures. If a user wanted to reveal their actual identity with
  their signature, then all past and future transactions of theirs no longer are
  anonymous because they share the same private key that generated the
  signature.</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, anonymous
  transactions imply that transactions cannot be properly tracked, that the goods or
  services involved cannot be known. This in turn implies that governments cannot
  properly track, verify, or tax Bitcoin transactions (Reid, Jackson, &ldquo;26 USC
  &sect; 61 - Gross income defined&rdquo;).</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another counter to
  Bitcoin&rsquo;s decentralized ideals is that the Bitcoin network, while consisting of
  crowdsourced servers, is maintained by the Bitcoin Foundation. All Bitcoin software is
  written and updated by the Bitcoin Foundation, including verification and proof-of-work
  checking. Thus, the integrity of the Bitcoin network relies on the idea that the users
  of it trust the Bitcoin Foundation to not abuse Bitcoin for their own personal
  gain.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Major Ethical Issues In Bitcoin Implementations:
  Trusting Third-Party Bitcoin Handlers</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Bitcoin
  transactions are routed by the owners of Bitcoin wallets through a third-party
  transaction system, often a &ldquo;Bitcoin exchange&rdquo; of sorts that handles the
  difficulties of creating and verifying transactions on behalf of the user
  (&rdquo;Virtual Currency Schemes&rdquo;). The problem, however, is that many of these
  third-party vendors do not handle users&rsquo; Bitcoin information securely. While the
  cryptographic system of Bitcoin itself is somewhat secure, major security flaws exist
  in many Bitcoin exchanges, of which a number have been hacked and Bitcoin information
  worth millions of US dollars has been stolen (&ldquo;List of Major Bitcoin Heists,
  Thefts, Hacks, Scams, and Losses&rdquo;).</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ethical
  dilemma, then, is that using one of these Bitcoin exchanges breaks the entire Bitcoin
  paradigm of abandoning the need to trust others in favor of cryptographic proof. The
  use of an exchange requires the user to have trust in that exchange to not steal their
  personal Bitcoin information and to have proper security to reduce vulnerability to
  hacking attempts. One could argue that one needs to trust a Bitcoin exchange even more
  than a &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; bank in the American financial system. While federal
  banks are FDIC insured, Bitcoin exchanges are not, and one cannot necessarily claim
  insurance on a Bitcoin wallet in the same way as is possible in a federal bank. In this
  case, surprisingly, the deregulation and anonymity of the Bitcoin financial system
  requires that users have more trust in one another than they would in a more
  traditional banking system.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3 c5">Virtual Money in the Real World</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">The Challenges of Using a Virtual Currency in the Real
  World</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Despite being originally designed as a digital currency intended
  for online transactions, more and more physical retail locations are beginning to
  accept Bitcoin for purchases. In theory, there shouldn&rsquo;t be any issue with this;
  in the same way that a customer can use Square or PayPal to directly transfer funds
  digitally, they should also be able to transfer Bitcoins to the vendor. However, the
  Bitcoin protocol presents a few challenges.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Verification time</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Although a user is able to
  instantaneously broadcast his or her intent to transfer Bitcoins from one wallet to
  another, whether or not this transfer is successful is not verified until ten to sixty
  minutes later.</span> <span class="c9">This delay is an inherent feature of the Bitcoin
  protocol and does not appear to be patchable.</span> <span>For retailers where goods
  must be exchanged immediately, this delay opens the doors to a poor experience for
  customers attempting to use Bitcoins, or worse, fraudulent purchases. Such lag times do
  exist in other forms of payment, such as credit cards, but the risk is mitigated by
  intermediaries (Stephy). It&rsquo;s unclear if a new transaction paradigm where vendors
  assume all of the fraud risk will be viable for brick-and-mortar stores.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">PoS Systems</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>The tech-savvy Internet
  counter-culturists that currently use and advocate Bitcoin may have no problem
  installing the software, setting up their wallet, and transferring funds between
  accounts, but minimum-wage employees and average joes attempting to complete a
  transaction using Bitcoin, the process might not seem so easy. If coins are sent to the
  wrong address, there is no way of retrieving them or doing a chargeback.</span>
  <span class="c9">Transactions on Bitcoin are irreversible.</span> <span>To mask some of
  this complexity, various PoS systems such as Bitpay attempt to simplify the process by
  providing a GUI and API that remove many of the complexities of transferring Bitcoins
  and converting those Bitcoins to different currencies. However, they also increase the
  standard transaction fees and remove some of the anonymity of the protocol, making
  Bitcoin more like a standard currency. This hits at the crux of one of the issues with
  Bitcoin; it trips over some of its high-brow theory when implemented in the real
  world.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Taxation</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>According to U.S. tax
  code, all Bitcoin transactions should be taxed like any normal transaction (&ldquo;26
  USC &sect; 61 - Gross income defined&rdquo;). &nbsp;However, Bitcoin transactions raise
  numerous unique issues. From a practical standpoint, it&rsquo;s unclear when and how
  Bitcoins should be taxed. Because transactions are anonymous and a user can have
  multiple wallets, one could quite easily hide any Bitcoin revenue from the IRS. The
  wallet of the coffee shop down the street would look no different from the wallet of a
  Dutch citizen, for example. The two might only differ by time and number of transfers,
  neither of which would necessarily imply that a wallet is owned by a U.S. company.
  Additionally, it&rsquo;s unclear when in this process taxation should occur. Taxes are
  generally applied when a user converts their Bitcoins to USD via a conversion service,
  but as the Bitcoin exchange rate is still quite volatile, a user can miss a few
  thousand dollars in taxes simply by cashing out to USD at a time when the exchange rate
  is most beneficial.</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From another view, it&rsquo;s
  questionable one should even attempt to tax Bitcoin transactions in the first place. It
  is certainly understandable when Bitcoins are being converted to USD, as that
  represents verifiable income in the shape of U.S. currency. However, consider a
  scenario in which a business is able to pay all of its costs in Bitcoins and only
  accepts Bitcoins from patrons. Say, its suppliers, landlords, employees, etc. all
  accept Bitcoins as payment. Although the business might operate in the United States,
  it uses entirely virtual currency, so how should it be taxed, if at all?</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3 c5">Circumventing Authority</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Circumventing Authority with Bitcoins</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dual nature of
  anonymity and untracability make Bitcoin a prime vehicle to circumvent authority.
  Whether or not the motivation for avoiding higher powers is justified has become one of
  the hottest debates among Bitcoin commentators.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Illicit Transactions</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>When discussing the use of
  Bitcoins in commerce, illicit transactions are an inevitable topic. Bitcoin&rsquo;s
  anonymity and untraceability make it similar to its physical cash equivalents as an
  unintentional facilitator of illegal transactions. Can Bitcoin be held accountable when
  it is used for societal ills?</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>The site called &ldquo;Silk Road&rdquo; is a case example. The
  nearly three-year-old site, only accessible through the pseudo-anonymous Internet
  protocol Tor, is the world&rsquo;s largest Bitcoin marketplace. By being anonymous for
  both sellers and buyers, Silk Road almost welcomes the kind of clientele who are after
  its most popular items: illegal drugs. While Silk Road does dabble in almost any other
  illegal good you can think of, from forged IDs and banned books to weapons and
  commissioned poems, its bread and butter is the Drugs section, which boasts seven times
  as many listings as the next popular category (&ldquo;Using Silk Road&rdquo;). For this
  reason, many U.S. Congressmen and women are aggressively attempting to squash the site.
  However, because the owner of Silk Road is anonymous and Tor sites cannot be blocked by
  ISPs, law enforcement is resorting to attempting to intercept illegal packages as they
  enter the U.S. mail system and arrive at the purchaser&rsquo;s doorstep. This method
  becomes ineffective though as soon as the goods become digital as well, if the buyer
  purchases child pornography, for example.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Legality of the Silk Road aside, being all-online, all-Bitcoin
  marketplaces present its own challenges. Buyers have no real recourse if their
  transaction goes sour, as the Bitcoin protocol has no way to reverse transfers.
  Although sellers must pay a fee to register for the site and users are allowed to rate
  sellers after purchasing, there is still a high potential for fraud simply due to the
  entirely anonymous nature of the site.</span></p>

  <p class="c1 c7"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Gambling</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Given the current ban on online gambling in the United States,
  websites that offer such services seem like a perfect fit for an anonymous digital
  currency like Bitcoin. Indeed, a few sites like StrikeSapphire and BC-Casino have
  sprung up, but surprisingly, they haven&rsquo;t had customers flocking to them as one
  might expect them to in the current black market. Some cite the irreversibility of
  Bitcoin transfers as a major flaw in the platform that is keeping gamers away from
  Bitcoin. Other sites are also reluctant to begin accepting them due to the increased
  security risk; if the site is hacked, wallet numbers could potentially be erased or
  stolen, leaving no way of getting them back. However, according to one site owner,
  users who try Bitcoin generally stick with it in the future, while others continue to
  hop from payment platform to payment platform (Stradbrooke). He claims that users (and
  sites) enjoy the low transactions fees on Bitcoin, as well as the ability to easily
  move money from a site, an issue that cropped up when sites like Full Tilt Poker had
  their assets seized by U.S. Department of Justice in 2011. Players found the thousands
  of dollars they had put into the game&rsquo;s servers locked up and inaccessible during
  the investigation (Stradbrooke).</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some respects, online gambling with
  Bitcoins is equivalent to online gambling using Zynga points or any other digital
  currency. Although the currencies are not directly linked to the currency of any
  government, third parties are willing to exchange physical currencies for balances of
  these digital currencies, giving them substantial value.</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Bitcoins in
  sites like these also raises issues around the responsibility of data security and data
  breaches. When personal data is stolen on most sites, there are steps that can be taken
  to reduce the fallout; you can cancel your credit cards, avoid reusing passwords or
  simply change login information on other sites, or just switch sites in the future to
  avoid these kinds of issues. However, if a site is holding onto a user&rsquo;s Bitcoin
  wallet and there is a security breach, those Bitcoins are as good as gone. That
  number</span> <span class="c9">must</span><span>&nbsp;be reused on any other sites the
  user is on, so diversifying passwords won&rsquo;t work here. The currency isn&rsquo;t
  protected by a bank or government, so reimbursement isn&rsquo;t a possibility here.
  Even if the company feels generous enough to reimburse their users, the user must start
  an entirely new Bitcoin wallet. There&rsquo;s also no obvious limit to the theft; if I
  put $100 into a poker site and the poker site is attacked, I will lose at most $100.
  However, if that poker site is storing my Bitcoin wallet, the attackers basically have
  access to my entire bank account.</span></p>

  <p class="c3"><span class="c0">This source has solid analysis of the role of Bitcoin in
  online gambling. The site is poker-focused, and not bitcoin-focused, so the analysis is
  more legal and logistical rather than technical. Online gambling is currently banned in
  the United States, but the author points out many sites that escape this law by using
  Bitcoins as a digital currency which can be exchanged for USD later. We plan to use
  this source in the section on online gambling and bitcoin.</span></p>

  <p class="c3"><span class="c0">This is part of the official Bitcoin Wiki that defines
  and describes weaknesses of the system. These weaknesses are classified as being a
  potential problem, probably not a problem, or definitely not a problem, helping to
  dispel myths about the currency. Many of the issues listed as potential problems appear
  to be inherent flaws of the protocol and will likely not be fixed in the future, so we
  must weigh the costs that these problems will have against the value of Bitcoin. The
  list is surprisingly candid and thorough.</span></p>
